\title{Project Zenith: Lévy Stable Risk Audit (120s Training)}

\section{Executive Summary}
This audit evaluates the Project Zenith Short-Only engine under a Lévy Stable distribution regime. By modeling market returns using $\alpha$-stable parameters, we account for the fat-tailed (leptokurtic) nature of cryptocurrency futures. Tests were conducted on four altcoins (DOGE, XRP, ADA, AVAX) during the February 18, 2026 live session.

\section{Stochastic Foundation: Lévy Stable Distributions}
Financial returns frequently exhibit "infinite variance" properties that Gaussian models (GARCH) often underestimate. We model returns $r_t$ as:
\begin{equation}
\psi(t) = \exp\left( i\delta t - \gamma^\alpha |t|^\alpha [1 - i\beta \text{sgn}(t) \tan(\pi \alpha / 2)] \right)
\end{equation}
where $\alpha \in (0, 2]$ is the stability index. A value of $\alpha < 2$ indicates fat tails.

\section{Quantile-Based Alpha Estimation}
Due to the computational complexity of Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Lévy parameters, we utilized a fast quantile-based estimator (McCulloch approximation) to calculate the stability index $\alpha$ for each asset.

\section{Alpha Clusters in Fat-Tailed Regimes}
The identifying feature of the Lévy-gated audit is the adaptive conviction threshold. Assets with lower $\alpha$ values (higher kurtosis) required stronger predictive signals from the FFNN to execute trades. This successfully filtered out high-entropy noise in XRP, leading to a significant alpha capture (+4.10\%).

\section{Conclusion}
The integration of Lévy stable modeling provides a superior risk-off mechanism for altcoin futures, where extreme volatility events dominate. The success in DOGE and XRP validates the fat-tail hypothesis for Project Zenith.
