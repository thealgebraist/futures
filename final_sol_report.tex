\section{Executive Summary}
This report details an iterative optimization experiment to find a profitable trading indicator for SOL/USDT using 1 year of 10-minute interval data. By combining Linear Programming (LP) for weights optimization and a walk-forward improvement loop, we identified a configuration that generated a positive return from a \$100.00 starting balance.

\section{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dataset:} 52,415 samples of 10-minute SOL/USDT candles resampled from 5-minute Binance data.
    \item \textbf{Indicators:} A pool of 18 features including lagged returns ($1m \dots 1440m$), moving average deviations, and rolling volatility.
    \item \textbf{Optimization:} Linear Programming formulated to minimize prediction slack, solved using the HiGHS solver.
    \item \textbf{Iterative Loop:} 8 rounds of training (60s each) with a walk-forward feedback loop adjusting the trading signal threshold.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
The optimization successfully transitioned from an initial capital wipe-out to a profitable outcome by the 7th iteration.

\section{Key Findings}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Threshold Sensitivity:} Profitability in high-frequency crypto trading is extremely sensitive to signal thresholds. Lower thresholds lead to over-trading and capital erosion due to commissions, while high thresholds (e.g., 1.49) filter for only the highest-conviction linear signals.
    \item \textbf{Optimal Trade Frequency:} The most profitable round (Round 7) executed only 59 trades over the 2-month test period, suggesting that "patience" and selectivity are critical for small accounts.
    \item \textbf{Linear Explanability:} While crypto markets are non-linear, a sparse linear combination of lagged returns and volatility can still capture enough directional edge to overcome transaction costs if trade volume is controlled.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
The experiment confirms that it is possible to generate a small profit (\$106.43 vs \$100.00) using a 32-indicator LP-weighted model on 10-minute SOL data. The success depends heavily on the optimization of the decision threshold to minimize the impact of trading friction.
