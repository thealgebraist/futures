\section{Introduction}
As requested, we reran the predictive analysis and trading simulations using 1-minute resolution data spanning 4 months. Due to data availability, Binance BTCUSDT was used as the high-resolution instrument.

\section{Dataset Scaling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total Steps}: 172,800 minutes (~4 months)
    \item \textbf{Training Set}: 138,240 samples
    \item \textbf{Test Set}: 34,560 samples (~28 days)
    \item \textbf{Resolution}: 1 minute
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Performance}
The 512-neuron FFNN was trained for 120 seconds. The training achieved an MSE of 0.0461. The higher MSE compared to 10-minute data reflects the increased entropy and volatility inherent in 1-minute price action.

\section{Trading Simulation Results}
The simulation was conducted over the final month of the dataset.

\section{Conclusion}
Scaling to high-frequency (1-minute) data significantly degrades the model's performance under the current architecture. The bidirectional strategy suffered from high variance and cumulative losses, while the short-only strategy remained more resilient but still failed to achieve profitability. This indicates that the 16-input 4-output structure may lack sufficient predictive horizon or filtering for high-frequency noise without further alpha refinement.
