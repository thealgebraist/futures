\section{Introduction}
This experiment uses Linear Programming (LP) to find the optimal weights for a set of high-frequency indicators to predict the direction of SOL/USDT price movements over a 10-minute horizon. We use 3 months of 1-minute data from Binance.

\section{Methodology}
We formulate the problem as finding a separating hyperplane $(w, b)$ that minimizes the sum of slack variables $\xi_t$, which is equivalent to a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) problem solvable via LP:
\begin{align*}
\text{minimize} & \quad \sum_{t=1}^M \xi_t \\
\text{subject to} & \quad y_t (\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}_t + b) \ge 1 - \xi_t \\
& \quad \xi_t \ge 0
\end{align*}
where $y_t$ is the sign of the next 10-minute return and $\mathbf{x}_t$ includes lagged returns and volatility proxies.

\section{Results}
The LP was solved using 10,348 subsampled training points.

\toprule
Indicator & Weight \\
\midrule
Ret\_1m & 0.0627 \\
Ret\_5m & -0.2297 \\
Ret\_10m & 0.1007 \\
Ret\_60m & 0.1933 \\
Ret\_120m & -0.2813 \\
Vol\_60m & -0.1976 \\

\end{tabular}

\section{Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Significant Indicators:} The 120-minute and 5-minute lagged returns showed the highest absolute weights, suggesting that both short-term mean reversion and medium-term trend are key factors.
    \item \textbf{High-Frequency Friction:} The simulation (Final Capital: \$4.40) resulted in significant loss primarily due to transaction costs and the difficulty of predicting short-term returns linearly. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
Linear Programming provides a formal weights optimization framework, but the high volatility and trading costs of SOL/USDT at the 1-minute level make profitable execution challenging for small accounts.
