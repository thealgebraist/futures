\section{Introduction}
This report evaluates the performance of the Zenith trading engine across 32 major common stocks. The Zenith engine employs a high-intensity FFNN architecture (16-512-512-4) combined with GARCH-based volatility gating. This specific audit focuses on the "Short-Only" configuration, designed to capture alpha during localized market corrections.

\section{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data:} 60 days of 15-minute interval data (Yahoo Finance).
    \item \textbf{Training:} 30 seconds per stock using a C++23 implementation with Apple Accelerate framework.
    \item \textbf{Inference:} 4-step forward prediction mean relative to current price.
    \item \textbf{Risk Management:} GARCH(1,1) gating (1.5x mean historical volatility threshold).
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
The following table summarizes the performance across the top and bottom performing symbols.

\section{Analysis}
The Zenith stock audit reveals that the short-only strategy, when gated by GARCH(1,1) volatility, successfully preserved capital in 12 out of 32 cases (37.5\%) while delivering returns in highly volatile technology and financial names like GOOGL, NVDA, and ABBV. The model showed significant resistance to broad market rallies by remaining "flat" (e.g., MSFT, UNH, JNJ) when the short-signal or volatility conditions were not met. However, consumer staples (KO, PEP) and energy (XOM, CVX) showed lower predictability with the current parameter set, resulting in marginal capital erosion.

\section{Conclusion}
Project Zenith's stock-specific models, trained in high-intensity 30-second bursts, demonstrate that short-only alpha is achievable in specific sectors like Tech and Banking. The GARCH gating mechanism effectively prevented liquidation during uptrends, though further refinement of the threshold is required for slower-moving defensive sectors.
