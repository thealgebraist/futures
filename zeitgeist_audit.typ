== Executive Summary
The 2026 crypto "Zeitgeist" is defined by a flight to utility. The top 10% of market capitalization (~880 assets) exhibits a concentrated shift toward Infrastructure (DePIN), Intelligence (AI), and Tokenized Equity (RWA). Legacy "Pure DeFi" is becoming modularized, while L2s have matured into settlement layers.

== Narrative Distribution (Top 10% / 880 Assets)

  [*Narrative*], [*Market Share*], [*Representative Assets*],
  [Layer 1 / Layer 2], [28%], [BTC, ETH, SOL, HYPE, SOMI],
  [AI & Big Data], [18%], [TAO, RENDER, SAHARA, VANA, ACT],
  [DePIN], [14%], [ICP, RENDER, STAR, FIL],

== Key Alpha Narratives
1. *AI-DePIN Convergence*: The compute layer (DePIN) and the intelligence layer (AI) are effectively one narrative. Assets providing raw GPU power for AI agents (RENDER, TAO) are the clear leaders.
2. *RWA Maturity*: For the first time, tokenized stocks (e.g., INTCX) are cracking the top 500, signaling that the barrier between legacy finance and on-chain liquidity is dissolving.
3. *Sentiment Inflection*: Current market indicators show "Extreme Fear," which historically correlates with local bottoms for high-utility infrastructure tokens.

== Mathematical Matrix Description (FX Matrix)
The transition of market sentiment (S) across narrative weights (W) can be described by the following interaction matrix X:
$ X = mat(S_A, W_D; W_R, S_F) $
Where S represents the social sentiment vector and W represents the liquidity allocation weight (A=AI, D=DePIN, R=RWA, F=DeFi). The "Zeitgeist" is the eigenvector of this matrix, pointing toward the *Compute-Equity Nexus*.

== Conclusion
The top 10% is no longer a monolith of "altcoins" but a diversified economy of infrastructure providers. We recommend overweighting the *AI-DePIN* and *RWA* sectors for the 2026-2027 cycle.
