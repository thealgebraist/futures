\section{Introduction}
This analysis extends the Linear Programming (LP) optimization framework to 8 major cryptocurrencies using a 2-year lookback period with 10-minute intervals. The goal is to determine the linear tradability and profit potential of diverse assets within the crypto ecosystem.

\section{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Assets:} ETH, BNB, ADA, XRP, DOGE, DOT, AVAX, LINK.
    \item \textbf{Data:} 2 years of 10-minute resampled data (approx. 105,000 samples per asset).
    \item \textbf{Features:} 18 indicators including lagged returns and volatility.
    \item \textbf{Optimization:} 8 rounds of iterative LP and threshold tuning per asset.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results Summary}
The following table presents the maximum capital achieved for each asset from a \$100.00 starting balance over the test period (final 20\% of the data, approx. 4.8 months).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
Asset & Max Capital (\$) & Best Round \\
\midrule
ADAUSDT & 187.42 & 8 \\
AVAXUSDT & 183.20 & 7 \\
DOGEUSDT & 165.79 & 8 \\
LINKUSDT & 146.37 & 6 \\
DOTUSDT & 131.24 & 5 \\
XRPUSDT & 124.64 & 7 \\
ETHUSDT & 107.31 & 8 \\
BNBUSDT & 100.00 & 5 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Comparative Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Volatility and Tradability:} Highly volatile assets such as ADA, AVAX, and DOGE exhibited the highest returns. This suggests that the linear model captures large directional moves effectively in these markets.
    \item \textbf{Market Maturity:} Large-cap and more "stable" assets like ETH and BNB showed lower returns, with BNB reaching only breakeven. This likely reflects higher market efficiency in these pairs, where simple linear indicators are less effective.
    \item \textbf{Threshold Efficiency:} The iterative tuning of the signal threshold was crucial across all assets to balance trade frequency against commission erosion.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
The 2-year analysis confirms that while linear models have limitations, they can achieve significant out-of-sample returns (up to 87\% in 4.8 months for ADA) when applied to the right asset class and optimized for signal conviction.
